Dear Bubber,
                  Mama and I went on a wild goose chase yesterday.
                  Aunt K                   went to B Wednesday morning to look over a job at the K D Hospital thinking x it would be the thing she was looking for, but when the work was lined out to her she found out that they wanted a super woman not a supervisor. You kow what a poor housekeeper she has always been. These were some of the duties she was to have ; supervising the kitchen and personally serve forty trays a day , set and serve the xxx nurses table, see that the place was cleaned up every day, check in and out the laundry every day, plan all the meals and see that they were properly prepared, and in her spare time oversee the nurses and the nurses home.
                  Mama and I drove ocer after her Thursday afternoon and xxxxxxxx K was completely exhausted after she got home. On our arrival K and I had a letter from the blind institute telling her to report for duty Sept 1st. very much to our rejoicing. I really think she will like her new work. she will be house mother in the dormitory for the small children. Just simply to see that they are properly dressed for all occasions and on time for their meals,
                  There is not much news in town. We are expecting the new football coach Monday and he will immediately start football practice in order to get lined up for the first few games. And when that starts the griping also begins. all about the coach, the referees, the players and general reasons why D did not win the game/
                  Wiley has had one of his school friends here for a few days, but having to go out with Mr W again H has the job of x entertaining the boy much to his dislike. Hubert had a date with S C’s visiter last night, and was driving Dad’s car out on the river road, and of course he says hee cannot account for it but the car just gently slipped into the ditch and he had to send for the wrecker to pull him out. He cornered me this morning almost before I got up to ask me not to put the charge on Dad’s bill.
                  Cousin C and C are both fine C is doing better and I am sure she will improve after K leaves . You know how she hate to have anybody in her kitchen.
                  Do not worry about any of the family. Every one is fine.
                                    Love Sis

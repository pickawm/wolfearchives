Dear Bubber,
                  We are all just fine. We are looking for the boys some time next week. Xxx            is coming just as soon as school is out and spend a week and he wants Mama and I to drive back with him for the exercises but until he gets here we will not be able to make any definite plans for the trip; Of course they are boht anxious to get home and they both make out that they are most terribly and extremely desirious of a job. Doctor is miserable and so is Mama trying to keep him at home and find-ing some thing for him to do and          doing every thing he can to keep from doing any thing around the place.
                  Can you imagine who we found in our kitchen this morning when we came out. Old Aunt Maria Oulpepper, and not one day older in the looks than she was when she came to the house to wait on Mama every two years. We showed her the pictures of all the family and when she saw                                    she said, ‘ Does he look that much of a man’. She says that she is 100 years old and hasn’t got even one wrinkle more than she had when she was here the last time.
                  We have been stalking birds all week . We have found a tanagerx, an oriole and a thrush but have not been able to trap or catch any of them. We have three red birds and are trying to start us an aviary.

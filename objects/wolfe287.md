                  E and Mr  W      went to the northern part of the state. They will be back Friday night. This will be the great-est thing that has ever happened to W               , as Mr W’s        influ-ence cannot be questioned. W                is nice , gentlemanly and good looking as well as very alert and good company and seems to fit the place admirably.
                  D              is still working. Not very hard though. He has a healthy coat of tan and a horrible griping disposition.
                  C is on her vacation and R      is working in her place. She is very good but she does not have the nice clean odor xxxx that C              has. She is smart though. Has the house cleaned up almost before I get up in the morning and you know I can hardly stand that.
                  Our bird house is not full yet, but xxxxxxxxxxxxx the collection is gradually growing. Hubert is the hotel keeper. He has raised six birds, a jay, three mocking birds and two thrushes and has killed more than twice that many feeding them on sour milk and bread. Of course nothing you can say will make hi change their diet.
                  Do not worry about Mama. She is just fine, Every body else is o k
                                                      Love
                                                      Sis

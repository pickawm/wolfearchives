Dear B
                  Corinne left yesterday for the coast, to have her dental work finished. She looked like a different person when she left, which is of course perfectly natural. Anyone who xxxxxxx affected by three meals a day at the W’s: just aint human.
                  H              is still at home expecting somebody to come and beg him to work for them.
                  Mr W seems tickled to death with W                . You’d almost think W was running for Governer and Mr W              was his chauffeur; from the way he raves over him.
                  D              is going to work again Monday morning. He using a team of Dad’s horses.
                  J     and Mr R are still out west. I’m glad she will have another subject to talk about when she comes back, as I al) ready know all her old conversation by heart. We had a card from her and I believe that they thought that they could go to Hollywood and come in direct contact with all the screen cele-brities. But this cards says that they have seen only one star and that was Karl Dane.
                  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                  Before C   came back R     cleaned the house from bottom to top. The first day C    was here she looked all over the house trying to find something to clean. She pouted for a week be-cause she couldn’t find anything to work on.
                  Cousin C            was here xxxxxxxx only one day this week . He hardly eats anything and it makes Mama mad xxxxxxx because he will not drink ice waterin hot weather. C still serves his coffee to him in the yard every morning he’s here/
                  Now that the family news has been told, the next  th  ing of interest is the announcement of L                O    S’s marriage. I have not seen the official announcement, but F   M told us that M H          told her that C’s wife told them. Any this man H   K                 , has been corresponding with L O               for several months. The S’s knew him and his family in F  and xxxx according to their story, said he had always said that he was going to marry L O. It is rather a romantic xxxx tale, and the S’s have aired every bit of it to the public. L O confided to V K and Hilda 2W and they confided in every body they met. Besides that each member of the S family had someone they just had to xxx tell, and everything that was in each of H’s letters and everything that L O wrote back to H was the topic of conversation whenever anyone met one of the S’s/

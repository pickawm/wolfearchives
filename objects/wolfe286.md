Dear      B
                  Had you thought that today is Dad’s birthday. Even he has not gotten too old to have them. Do not forget that the     th of Oct is Mama’s and it takes about ten days for us to get a letter from you.
                  I have tried to write you at least once a week, but it takes more than a week for any thing ot happen in C        . Some-times it takes at least nine months, but things have been known to happen in less time than that.
                  Mama and I went nine thousand miles out in the country in search ofan old fashioned spool-bed stead. How we got to the old negro womans house is still a puzzle to me. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx I told her that I’      d trade her a new bed for her old one, and she would not even talk of trading until she understood perfect ly who I was. You see that xxxxx is what comes of having a rep-utation . I am sending her a brand new iron bed stead all dec-orated in blue and silver for her old antique. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx That is the way I had to picture it to her before she would consent to the exchange. She said she would send the bed up to me and even wanted to throw in her old mattress and springs. But I told her I thought she would find them more comfortable than I would?
                  We have been having an awful tome with the leaky roof/ Every time it rains which is every day the roof leaks in a new place. Will C says he can fixit and Dad promised to paper the living room over as soon as it is repaired.
                  Mama is just fine. She stays busy trying to plan and pre-pare three squares a day for two football men. D is the easiest person to please in the respect I have ever seen We are crazy about him.
                  Hubert likes his work xxxx more all the time. He says the hotel at L has swell meals and one can have as much as one x wants; which of course eases Mamas mind, since xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx she seems to think that outside of Casa W food can be had only in small quantities.
                  Wiley is out for football and everybody in C will be mighty disappointed if they do not see his name in big head lines.
                  We have had bad luck with the wild birds. All that we have left now is a jay, a dove and two red birds.

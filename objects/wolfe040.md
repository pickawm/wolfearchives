\f1 \cf0 Dear Jack,
\f0 \
\

\f1 	I\'92ve intended writing you since your friend Ticknor was here a couple of weeks ago. He seemed a very pleasant sort although slightly juvenile in places. I found his obscene limericks very palatable. We talked lengthily one night about books and sex, and another night about sex and books. His [crossed out] regard for your friendship and company gave us one strong bond in common. He told me some things that pleased me a lot about what a swell artist people are discovering you are. You can\'92t smother ability even in Mississippi I\'92m glad yo [crossed out with pencil] see. Life slides along with me in a comparatively amusing fashion as a newspaperman. I still enjoy soft white thighs, good talk and good whiskey, and the early\'97morning mist sometimes remind[s is crossed out] me of the white vapors that rose from Paris that dawn we saw together from Sacre Coeur.\'a0

Dear Bubber,
The town has been full of visiters for the last few days and the social callendar has been fuss to overflowing. Parties morning noon and night. FM had a party for her visiter this morning at the put put. They came back to her house for lunch a swell lunch ? chicken patties, potatoes chips two kinds of sandwiches, pickled peaches, sweet pickles, ice tea and a new kind of lemon pie. W made the pies for her
The C    girls each have a visiter and they asked D   to call on them . As this was D’ s        first appearancein really polite society, W  and H              had an idea that he did not know exactly how to comport himself so they immediately began inspecting his clothing to see that he was properly dressed and then proceeded to ask him if had cards. They teased him so much that they had him almost at the point of cancelling his date.
Mrs M   is still laid up with her leg. She fell down the back steps and ruptured a blood vessel. Now she and H   can talk operations as her leg is almost as bad as his. You should have heard Mrs     M and K talking about the times they each had typhoid fever. neither could hear what the other said for xxx for their own speeches, but both of them were talking as hard as they could. Which reminds xxx me that J and Mr R were here Saturday and Sunday . I timed J after supper .She started at 7;30 and by 9;00 o’clock was still going strong. Without a break. I took a nap xxxxxxxx then and when I woke up she was still talking. I have no idea just what time she stopped. Fortunately she had xxx so much to talk about we only xxxx had to listen to the same conversation once.
Wiley is out again with Mr W after a week at home. H is still at hoe. The birds have gotten old enough to feed them selves and do not require so much attention, so he has nothing to do. He is very dissatisfied and anxious to get to work.
C              came back from her vacation with a tremendous grouch. Cousin C’s Mama died Sunday night. He certainly was crazy about her. We all hope he will move up to Columbia and live in the yard. We could hardly get along without him and he keeps the yard looking lovely.
Everyone is well and what appetites.
                  Love

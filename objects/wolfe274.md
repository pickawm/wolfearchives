June 24th,
Dear Mary,
                  Your letter of the 22, recieved today is what I most wanted from you. I appreciate it very much, and thank you for it. I also appreciate your bigness and generosity.
Your suggestion is entirely sound by any measure, and for the past twenty days has been my main concern. I have been trying to see myself as I must appear to you and Mama. And what I saw looking at things that way, stunk. It has depressed me noend. Because if I do stink, I cant even yet believe the cause of it is more than accident or misunderstanding. As Will Percy said, when he wrote of liking people and people liking him. If they didn’t, they just didn’t understand, because he was entirely likeable, and willing to be liked.
I think I am a pretty nice person. In fact I’m pretty sure of this, without any particle of vanity, or any of those other obnoxious things. I read it in people’s faces most of the time, and am occasionally favored with more concrete assurances. I’ve been trusted, and respected and deferred to, and people usually listen whenever I say anything. All of this, I must repeat, I’ve felt without the slightest conceit, but rather with a great deal of humilityand a lot of hope that some day I’ll really be the kind of person who will demand my own respect.
But for the reaction of my visit home, I’d never have indulged in this sort of introspection, even in private, much less on paper. But perhaps it’s good for me anyway, especially the part of it that deals with what I seem like to you at home.
                  The Army makes you hard. There’s no getting away from that. The sole, avowed, pointed purpose of the army is to train and direct men to kill and destroy. It’s not a gentle business. From induction on you are spoken to, and you are expected to respond in a hard, concise, unflowery manner. In much more subtle ways you are taught to be hard. How could it be anything else, since that’s your business as a soldier. You dont win a war with tact or consideration, but with force and ruthlessness. On top of this

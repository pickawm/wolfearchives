	The Gods have chosen to make me the victim of their whimsical [illegible], after years of believing that slowly my sight was vanishing & that like Milton, I would [illegible] only sit & wait, all is suddenly changed by the announcement of a certain noely-polly [maybe, nolly-polly] German eye specialist, Dr. [illegible], by name who clearly informed me after an examination that there was not a damn thing wrong with my eye. He picked up my spectacles \'97 the same which I had you include in my book plato, so [illegible] war I [illegible] their permanence on my nose \'97 are what the eminent doctor calls \'93femta glos\'94, No tell me that if it amuses me, to wear them; they do no harm. The tiny trace of stigmatism in my left eye is not even worth glasses!\
	Since Norway I have done without my glasses & find myself more the worst! The herr dokter seems to think the whole business [illegible] to a pathological condition. He told me that he would not risk his reputation by telling me I had nothing the matter with my optics if there actually was something wrong. He suggested I consult a specialist on the nasal tract to see if there was any explanation for my headaches [illegible] & between my eyes! I have done so & the only thing discovered has been a slight cloudiness in the left sinus region.\
	I am giving their very revolutionary idea a [illegible] tiny out for a couple of weeks. I\'92ll be damned if I know that to think about the matter or if what this doctor has said (& I feel his sincerity, & this reputation incidentally, my [illegible] ells me, is the [illegible \'97 crossed out] (put in Germany) when my eyes trouble me & didn\'92t know whether they actually hurt or if its just another one of my ideas; it\'92s a most humiliating position, Mozr Vinex.\
	My landlady is perfectly swell. She [illegible] went with me to the ^eye doctor, hid all the translating, explained that I was a poor student (so he charged me only 20 months $5\'97) & generally looked after me. Have found the \'93new\'94 Berlin very much on the American plan, with automats, Quick lunches, photomatons, etc., Kevin Fuedrieh [illegible] is the nuts for Hals & [illegible] [illegible \'97 torn bottom corner of paper] German lessons from a lady of the [illegible], now very poor\'97and very [illegible].\

P.S. I have left these borders very wide in case you want to write some letters home, or a novel, or something. \'97 Incidentally, have [illegible] the [illegible] after having pictures taken in a Photomaton. The razor wept but I had no pity. Shall send a few [illegible] of it to Olive, & other friends. \'97 [illegible, missing part of page] to Polloak. Luck on the Spanish expedition.\

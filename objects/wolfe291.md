C is still in the kitchen and R has the wash .
We have written you several times and several weeks (ineligible due to fire damage) maybe months ago about the expected heir to the D throne: to (ineligible due to fire damage) you know that woman is still working at the office and goes to work every day. K says she is so surprised as Mrs D is so modest about everything else. K evidently does not know that you can get a bet any place in town at 5 to 1 odds that the child will look not like its dad, Mr D, but her boss Mr S. There does not seem to be any modesty amoung women anywhere anymore.
I probably wrote you about H R and L B being married/ H cant be over sixteen and L not xx many days older. B T told W       that they had been married several days befor the family found it out, and they took immediate steps to have the mar-riage annulled. H is pretty rotten. You would be surprised to hear the xxx things that are being said about that set of girls. If they all come out without something to show for their rottenness it wil surprise e.
Bunk H xxxxxxxxx is now courting M C and she entertains him in short voile pajamas. She has never recovered from her operation. She has an abcess on one of the intestines and for w weeks they gave up hope for her recovery. Even now she is still in bed and B is there every night.
S H and S Mc have tried in every way possible to get xx married and each time one or the other of the families stop it This child is just D’s age and S is even younger. This is only a small part of what parents of this decade have to con-tend with. Every the boys and I tell Mama how glad we are that we were born in a different age and had the care and ad-vice we did have from her.
I know you cant be interested in this, but it is so hard to find something xx to write about. Every member of the fam-ily is O K.

                                                                                                            S

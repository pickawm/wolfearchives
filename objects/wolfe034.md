\f1 \cf0 Dear Jack,
\f0 \
\

\f1 	Thanks for [r corrected with pen] the Da Vinci postcard though she looks too fattish [second t written in with pen] around the chin to please me au lit. I\'92m sorta funny about fat chins\'85.

\f1 	The good old Minnekahda didn\'92t sail on Nov.1. She\'92s in the drydock [r corrected with typewriter] temporarily for repairs\'85damage we did coming over no doubt. Shall get a birth on the Pennland which sails on the eight [crossed out letter following the t in eight] instead. Have for the past two nights, and shall till I leave, stay with John Weld. His wife is at Nice and his apartment has two beds. As my pocketbook is limping throughout it pretty decent [typo crossed out, so actually de\strike \strikec0 ce\strike0\striked0 cent] of J. To have me over. He\'92s a damn generous, cordial sort of egg. Just finished [d is faded] a novel called \'93Gun Girl\'94 about a New York gang - sterette which [illegible, typo cover up] read all right in the couple of [o is faded] chaps. I looked at. Just writing the thing shoots him up several notches in my opinion.

\

\f1 	Have been trying like very hell to get a job here on one of the papers or in a news service. Have done the rounds thoroughly sans results. After hating Paris all during the last two weeks of Sept,. And the first Oct. I spent the last three messing around and finally landed my four pounds of raw meat [illegible, typo cover up] between yielding. cool thighs (not bought goods either). Otherwise I\'92ve done a hell of a lot of drinking, presenting Swedish [inserted]/whores with bracelets unintentionally while puffed, meeting Mae Murray, Italian Princesses, and Waldo Pierce, suffering headaches, strokes of conscience, making and breaking resolutions and in general [m after general] having a much more amusing time.
\f0 \
\

\f1 	Wired The New Yorker \'93any change of old job\'94 and they wired back \'93possible but not probable\'94 which is a magnificent way of leaving me on the fence. Shall shoot down to Charleston for a couple of weeks when I hit there will be no jobs around the home city though I\'92d like about six months there for some reason or other\'85mostly yo catch up on some reading.

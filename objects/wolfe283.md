Dear B
                  The time draws near when K takes her departure for the job at                       and I know you can hear the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the family circle. Really one more week zz the last one would have finished Mama. K has been trying to give xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx away everything that belongs to her to people you would not even spit on. The C’s , The S’s, the D’s and old A Me, She really ought to give A a riggin of harness, not only because she is a jackass, but because she simply cant keep the should-er straps to her brassier up, and is constantly going way down after them all over the street.
                  We had a very romantic wedding this week. V K married a man from O T , that she had met the night before. You would not believe all the things you heard about her. It has been told they met at a moonlight picnic Saturday night and decided to be married on their way back home. They left here at 12 30 P M and x drove down to N O for the ceremony . . Some of the things revealed’as I heard it’ were that he had more money than brains, had two other wives, both out of the ground, a Lincoln coupe, and was about forty five years old. So far there have been numerous stories connected with the affair, none of the damaging to her character, but things I would not like to have said about me.
                  The new football coach arrived and has been staying at the house. He is as big as Dad, expect in front and is the rankest country boy you ever saw. He is a mighty sweet person but does not know anything at all.
                  F and W are going to spend the week end in N o with J . xxxxxxxx I’m sure they will have a nice visitfor J does not leave anything undone for ones comfort and pleasure, if one can survive her endless onesided conversations. YOUr mar-ried sister certainly does love to talk.
                  H              has added two baby rabbits to the collection of wild animals and has to feed them with a medicine dropper.
                  D is playing tennis and getting himself in shape for the football gaes. The boys nearly fainted when the coach told the to run around the (?) school-house five times before the workout.
                  Cousin C has not been up this week. There is no

\f1 \cf0 Dear Jack,
\f0 \

\f1 	First want to thank you for all the portraits. The [illegible, missing part of page] Gorgons[?] were a swell-idea. Had let Notre Dame whip me of [illegible, missing part of page] the portraits you sent [illegible] two male heads & peace in the just [illegible] [illegible] ch\'e3o [illegible]: the t\'e9te virile of Boll\'edcelli [illegible] like sublime chapel in Rome (for [illegible] sake try to get down to see that place before you go home. \'97 even if it means starving for a week. You don\'92t wanna miss Mike, [illegible] pick a good sunny day, and see if you can humor a pair of opera glasses; also buy more of [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] prints which they sell at the entrance. They are damn nice and mesmerizing when the [illegible] or high levels [illegible] \'97 20 \'97 item the Twin Portrait [illegible] Hernando. I have two with Titan Home an [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible], & Rembrandt\'92s Man but their Gold Helm (K. Fred here). One [illegible] you best [illegible] at [illegible]. Women: Hille Bothe, Botticech\'ed [illegible] perfume in [illegible] Fresque de le villa [illegible], & that Dominico [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] of.

\f1 	Eldorado was about the most unique thing there I\'92ve seen here. All the [illegible] men [illegible] [illegible, scratched out word] dressed as women, with female voices, long hair painted and powdered eyes and cheeks feminine ways. Some were obviously men others were perfect except for the hips. Always look at the hips when in doubt, one had they cant well [illegible] [illegible] to look genuine even though they use little rubber things for breasts. The first [illegible]\'a0 was to express cry-[illegible] [illegible] as deep a voice as I could summon. (then eventually to assume myself and [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] my sex). That stye posted when I found a nice like War saw [illegible] to [illegible] with in French. There was even Ria who danced with me all night, let me hog her cocktail [illegible]\'a0 to the [illegible] of 3 [illegible], and then expressed herself in German that she would sleep with me f\'fce di\'e9 geld [for the money]. And I thought her as why, and so [illegible] & twice as wondrous, who was going to [illegible] me for my nice manners. But only that which is [illegible] [illegible], Mein Heur, and I being an idealist never [illegible] for tale. So we parted, and she was free from syphilis, and running [illegible] at the [illegible].

\f1 	[Illegible] I\'92d shoot down to Aix in Provence until the middle of Oct. or late, [illegible] [illegible] idea. Shall shout or hack [illegible] Paris \'97 [illegible] it [illegible] [illegible] here \'97 [illegible] of the tomorrow \'97 Sept 27 \'97 when I\'92m gonna cook for o [illegible] or one in the American newspaper there. All over [illegible] for a fourth. What you say [illegible] it. Summer [illegible] on Nov. 29 sounds good, [illegible, missing part of paper] have to want [illegible] of the [illegible].
\f0 \

\f1 	Further easy-going [illegible] [illegible] and tells no stone [illegible, crossed out word here] is [illegible] the what you call pride is this [illegible] [bottom of letter burned] got to [illegible] [illegible] by a crumpled [illegible].

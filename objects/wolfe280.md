Aunt K seems to be satisfied with her work. She really needed something and so did we. We hear from her x every week.
There is not much town news. the latest thing seems to be the separation of Mr and Mrs           S I know you can hardly believe that. I think they decided to quit while they were still good friends, which I think is the funniest expression in the world in connection with a thing of this kind. Mrs has given up all her club work even the luncheon club. From what I could gather Mr S tried to get to go into another territory xxxxxxxxx and make a home for hin, but she foolishly refused to do so thinking, I guess, that xxxxx her mother would live forever and she could stay at the hotel where she could be like the H boys/ Get a good bed to sleep in, three square meals a day, and not have to fish unless she wanted to.
On my way to dinner I gathered the news that the ling awaited arrival of the D baby had come off at last/ Alittle girl. I still cannot imagine Mrs D with a baby of any kind. And I have never seen such a lack of modesty as is displayed by the older women these days. She was at church Sunday morning and a dinner partie Monday night, which she left to go to the Hospital where the baby was born Tuesday morning at seven.
O well every body is O K
                                                      Love
                                                      S

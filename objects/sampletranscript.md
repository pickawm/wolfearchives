Boguechitto, Miss

May 19th, 1969.

Dear Karl: -

Please excuse this note book paper. I have real stationary but have so much to say to you chose this instead.

I, Aileen McDaniel Devin was reared in Brookhaven, went to school with Josie and Mary Wolfe. And I’m thought you are their brother. I’m kept up with you and your wonderful talent thinking all the while you are brother to Mary and Josie. Mary was one grade ahead me and Josie was older. If you are their brother remember where your parents lived near the Jewish Synagogue. I was an orphan and your beloved uncle Mr Chas Heuck was wonderful to me. He was Mayor in those days and owned the Opera House. Being civic minded and interested in children always offered a prize for the one selling most tickets to school plays, ball games etc.

Dear Karl: -
	Please excuse this note book paper. I have real stationary but have so much to say to you chose this instead.
	I, Aileen McDaniel Devin was reared in Brookhaven, went to school with Josie and Mary Waefe. And I’m thought you are their brother. I’m kept up with you and your wonderful talent thinking all the while you are brother to Mary and Josie. Mary was one grade ahead me and Josie was older. If you are their brother remember where your parents lived near the Jewish Synagogue. I was an orphan and your beloved Uncle Mrs. Chas [illegible] feuck[?] was wonderful to me. He was Mayor in those days and owned the Opera House. Being civic minded and intelectual in children always offered a prize for the one selling most tickets to school plays, ball games etc.
	I always [?] came up with the prize as being an orphan my tickets were few and far between. I well remember when Birth of Nation came out to Bharen was shown at Opera House. I bought the best ticket I could afford which was fifty cents upstairs on peanut row. When I got there for afternoon performance Mr. Chas was taking up tickets. Said Aileen come on going to give you a better seat and did down stairs from under the balcony which was next to box seats in those days. Did appreciate and love him for it.
	I’ve [?] take the Jackson news and I read with interest your article Sense now out and nonsense is in. You are so right. I am going to get the Revolution of [illegible] you referred to and read it. Your article was good and I enjoyed it throughly. I have called several to be sure to read. I have saved the article for our daughter to read. She lives in Jackson and want to be sure she reads. She is an only child but very fine. Did work in Miss Bank & Grant Co but now home rearing her first child a little girl just two months old. She loves the business world but guess that is natural. I worked all my life in office work first at Seareyo [?] Store in Bharen then fourteen years at McGcathe [?] in office. And Deerey was and is office worker. We both are retired but he is tax practitioner and works at home. We have several hundred tax customers and aside from money earned we love people and enjoy seeing our friends.
	My next trip to Jackson will call you. So glad you wrote the article and had published. Keep up the good work and I shall be looking forward to reading more. May God bless you and yours.

Mrs. Devrey Devin								Sincerely
Boguechetto, 39629								Aileen M. Devin

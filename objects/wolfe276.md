Dear Bubber,
n
                  I have already written you about Uncle                            death but for fear you have not received the letters, I wanted you to know about it. Very sudden but after the first shock things seem to have adjusted themselves nicely. Aunt    is with us and while she has quite a few ways that do not coincide with our way of doing things, she seems to be coming around and is improving.
                  Hubert has been home about ten days intermission. He left today for college as he has to be back tonight. Mama,                 and I are leaving Monday morning, driving through. Then we will return Wednesday.                            is at work with the Dixie Construction Co. cutting a right of way. The work seems a little heavy for him but he was glad to get anything to do. Neither                            or                             have made any effort whatever to g get anything to do, not even around the place.
                  The college boys and girls are gradually coming home. I guess B’s              place will be the hanging out place now for all of them.     B has rented a concrete garage near L’s cafe and has put a wood floor in it and opened up with a dance. Doctor did not go on account of Uncle C  but try to imagine if you can the conversation at the dinner table when the subject of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx dancing at B’s place was brought up. Even G W would not let his boys go. So far there is nothing the matter with the place itself but you know that B is a R and that is enough said as far as the general public is con-cerned especially connected with a thing of this kind.
                  J                and Aunt D were here for a few days after Un-clex C’s death. Aunt              gave J quite a few things. I’mn sure J’ s main object in coming over and helping Aunt was the fact that she could ask for as many things as she want-ed. When she left the car was so weighted downshe could not possibly have gotten another thing in it And she left a book rack and a card table that she could not carry. Dad says this is the first time that we ever had to wash dishes before we could finish a meal, but he thinks that if josie comes a few more timeswe wont have anything left/
                  Every body is fine.
                                                      Love S
                                                                        is

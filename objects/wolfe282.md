                  D came home one day last week xxx with the report that mrs C S had twins. Then we heard the same thing from another source. This morning E S came to the house and told us that Mrs C S had one boy, born last night. But then people in C always know things before they happen xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and the reports are invariably twice as bad as the actuality.
                  Every body is just fine , and continually asking when you will be home .
                                    Love
                                         S

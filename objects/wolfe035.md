\f1 \cf0 	This European expedition of mine has been a crazy quilt of a thing. Seven months up the creek from the god old conservative young-men-must-make-thir-w way standpoint possibly. Loafing, that\'92s all, but not pure and simple. That\'92s the saving and the losing clause. There were efforts to \'93dope it all out\'94 which amounted to the insipid chattering of adolescence. What I\'92m gonna come to damn soon is an acceptance of this old frame of mine and a constant kicking it in the butt night lead me on into a respectable poverty. The day, or rather the months of this self-clawing, self-scratching, and mental masturbation as our Greek friend put it must beat [typo covered with random typed words] retreat. Whenever I get to the point of putting that old WORK thesis into application at a time when I\'92m free from all the funny self-doubts, inhibitions, and other crap-crap, that is when we\'92ll see where we stand. I don\'92t think its all laziness. I think its just a lot of stuff that\'92s chocked up in me, and which I\'92m not looking at in the right light (the metaphor is mixed, but so is the idea).

\f1 	Glad you are finding Florencea stimulus. Maybe I\'92ll see you when you dock at New York in December. Why not check on my being in town by calling telephone number BUTTERFIELD 9840 and asking Miss Emily Tobias or Miss Eleanor Tobias (two old cousins) [typo covered with random typed words] where I am.

\f1 	Thanks for the Frustration book idea. Maybe I\'92ll use the Reed incident in a short story. It was plenty dramatic at the time. Best to Pollak, and so long, old man. Its been damn pleasant knowing you before Fame has set her finger on your brow. Hoping that your bed will bear the weight of other than you alone before Europe is no more\'85..

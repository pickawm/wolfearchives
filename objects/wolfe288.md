Dear Bubber,
                  We are all just fine. We are looking for the boys home some time next week. Hubert is coming just as soon as school is out and spend a week and he wants Mama and me to drive back with him for the exercises but until he gets here we will not be able to make any definite plans for the trip. Of course

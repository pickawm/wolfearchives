sleep s                  In addition he said that they threw their empty bottles in his back yard.
                  W is still out with the future governor of A . I do not know whether anyone wrote you that Mr W had announced for Gov for next term and W  is driving him over the state. Mr W seems delighted with W and thinks he is mighty fine. Mama had a card from xxxx yesterday saying that Mr W was lovely ‘ ‘ and couldn’t do enough for him. We look for them to-night. Mama is so well satisfied that she knows where W is with allx the time and who he is with, and Mrs W is so pleased           to have W with Mr W in case he gets sick or something.
                  H is moping around the house moaning over the fact that he has no clothes to wear. He still has hopes of the highway job. I believe he is actually ashamed to go out on account of not having anything to do.
                  Aunt K is still in F c and will not be back before about the 25th. We are looking for C before long. She has been on the coast having dental work done and her mouth has been in such bad condition she has been delayed about getting new xxxxx teeth. As soon as this work is finishedn , she is coming up here. J and Mr R are on their way to California and will be gone three weeks. Wouldn(t you llike to hear their report of the trip. If there are no shows to go to I am sure they will not see a thing? I’m sure Mr R’s idea of the west is H Hollywood and he might as well sleep all the way till he gets there.
                  I cant think of anything else that has happened. Every body is well.
                                    Love
                                                      Sis
